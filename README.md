# Course Description

> The collection of data about us starts just before we are born, it continues when we go to school, enter the labour force and when we register and use any kind of service from an institution or a platform. Data are also produced as we go about our daily activities –shopping, banking, making phone calls, ordering a taxi, posting to social media, navigating the city, voting, exercising, and filing taxes. Data are also collected as we do exceptional things such as crossing borders, checking into hospital, if we commit crimes, and when we die. We are datafied, we leave behind data shadows or trails and living a dataless life is nearly impossible and sometimes puts you on a watch list. 

> The course covers a wide range of topics, themes and concepts such as data infrastructures, smart cities, the internet of things (IoT), surveillance and sousveillance, algorithmic governance, predictive policing, the quantified self, location-based services, data collection devices, geodemographics and open data among many others. In this course we examine how data shape actions and the material outcomes of data. 


# Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:

* Distinguish big data from small data, and to recognize data types;

* Conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;

* Recognize the interconnections between data, their infrastructures, collection and dissemination technologies, software, platforms and how data are produced and used;

* Identify data politics;

* Understand the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

### Infographic Project (35%)

You will produce an informative, relevant, accurate, purposeful, fun, and creative infographic about open data at the City of Ottawa. It can be about: 
* how open data came to be,
* any dataset in the open portal, 
* the open data licence, policy or directive, 
* open data applications, contests, 
* open government, 
* key performance indicators, 
* mapping, or 
* crowdsourcing projects at the City. 

We will look at many examples in-class and do exercises to get you ready. You can discuss a process, findings in the data, an issue that uses any City data, compare things, show a dataset flowline, tell a story with a dataset, unpack the pieces of a dataset, discuss data found in a report, etc.. It can be digital or it can be done by hand.

**Assignment 1 - Data Description (Due @ 8:00AM Sept. 14) (10 %) 2-3 pages:**

> Look for any dataset that interests you and download the data.  In 2-3 two pages, report the download process, where you found these data (e.g. a portal, news blog, data library, etc.), and describe the dataset. Explain your interest in this dataset, what might you use the data for? Be sure to provide a full citation of the dataset. You are welcome to use screen captures and they will not go against your page count! The following is a list of ideas to help you write this short report, **but do not limit yourselves to these:** Who produced the data and for what purpose? How are the variables defined? Dates? Format? Geographic extent? Was there a manual or definitions? Any limitations with these data? Were they free to access? What rights do you have to use these data? Do you trust these data and if so why? This is a short report.

**INFOGRAPHIC A – (Due Week 2 Sept. 14)**
 > Go to the MacOdrum Library MAP section on the 1st Floor. Peruse the COMS2200/COMS4407 2018 display on top of the map cabinets.  Examine the books & maps and pick 3 that you find interesting. Cite (use proper citation) these 3 resources in the **CULearn Forum** and explain how you think this will help you with your infographic project. Share any interesting or useful tips. You can include a picture if you want but you do not have to (note that if you do, all images require captions). 

## Week 2 (Sept. 14) – Crowdsourcing & Digital Humanitarianism

This week we will learn about user generated content (UGC), citizen science, crowdsourcing & volunteered geographic information (VGI). We will also discuss divergent views on data humanitarianism. In this lecture we will also examine crowdsourcing in action.

**INFOGRAPHIC B – (Due Week 3 Sept. 21)**

> Find 2 infographics in the library, online or anywhere else about any topic.  The infographics can be about concepts, processes, a paper, a story, and should include data, etc.  Cite and share an image of these in the CULearn Forum. In a few words, explain why you selected these, how you found them, why you think they are good, discuss if there is room for improvement? What kind of visualization techniques did they use? What would you do differently?

## Week 3 (Sept. 21) – Open Data & Guest Lecture by Darrel Bridge, City of Ottawa 

This week, students will learn about open data policies, practices and processes. For some open data will make the world a better place and democratize institution while others think this promise is a myth and we will discuss both. We will have a guest speaker from the City of Ottawa, who is the client for your Infographic project. **Darrell Bridge** is the Senior Data Analytics Strategist, Open Data Lead, City of Ottawa, Service Innovation & Performance Department (SIPD). Students will learn about open data in the real world and will be exposed to indicator and open data projects.

## Week 5 (Oct. 5) - Counting You

In this lecture students learn about some of the infrastructures and institutions dedicated to counting them. They will discover why they matter to the nation and government administrations. They will begin to see the social shaping qualities of data and maps, and how they are part of social, technical and geographical imaginaries. The in-class discussion will focus on the Census of Canada, the cancellation of the long-form in 2010 and its reinstatement in 2016. Concepts such as governmentality, biopolitics, nation building, will be discussed. Can you imagine and guide the nation without data?

## Week 7 (Oct. 19) - Sorting You

This week students learn about the power of classification systems and segmentation techniques. Students will discover that classified things are socially constructed, that there may not be ‘natural kinds’ of things yet things get sorted nonetheless, and once sorted it is hard to imagine those things in any other way. This will also include an examination of unique identifiers (UIDs), algorithms and methods by which data about you is collected to situate and put you in your place.

#### INFOGRAPHIC F – (due Week 8 Nov. 2)

Create a DRAFT infographic and upload an image of it to the CULearn Forum. In the Forum indicate the tool/s you used to create it. 2 peer reviewers will be assigned to review this DRAFT infographic.

### Fall Break - No Classes (Oct. 22-26)

## Week 8 (Nov. 2) – Identifying You

Unique identifiers (UID) are a big data enabling technology. These include biometrics, RFID, QRCodes, facial recognition software, barcodes, social-insurance-numbers, postal codes, credit card numbers and etc. UIDs not only identify you, and help you find things, they also link you to any number of other datasets, objects and locations including markets and into any number of platforms.

#### INFOGRAPHIC G – (due Week 9 Nov. 9) (5%) 
Peer Reviewers review the 2 infographics assigned to you according to the Infographic rubric. You can mark up a document in pen and take a picture of it to send to your class mate, or you can edit directly in the document. Be constructive, honest, direct, and provide useful suggestions. Submit your peer review document to the CULearn Assignment Area and email each review to each of your class mates.

## Week 9 (Nov. 9) - Watching You

State institutions are often engaged in surveillance activities. The Canadian Border Service is one such institution, and airports are a unique assemblage of surveillance technologies, data collection and systems. Sometimes surveillance is to reduce harm, detect fraud and cheating, and other times it is to monitor behaviour in order to either serve you better or to market to you. This week students will also discover concepts such as dataveillance, sousveillance, counterveillance, and surveillance.
